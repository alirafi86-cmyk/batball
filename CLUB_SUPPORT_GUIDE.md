## Troubleshooting

### "Page won't load" or "Blank screen"

**Try these steps:**
1. **Refresh the page** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
2. **Clear browser cache:**
   - **iPhone:** Settings → Safari → Clear History and Website Data
   - **Android:** Chrome → Menu → Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
   - **Desktop:** Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Check "Cookies" → Clear data
3. **Close and reopen app/browser**
4. **Check internet connection** (app needs WiFi first time)
5. **Restart your phone** if still not working

**Still not working?** 
- Try a different browser
- Try on a different device
- Check if you have the latest iOS/Android

---

### "Data disappeared after I closed the app"

**This is normal if:**
- You don't have the app installed (just website bookmark)
- You're using incognito/private browsing mode
- Browser cache was cleared

**Solution:**
1. **Install as app** (see Installation Guide above)
2. **Use normal browsing mode** (not incognito)
3. **Export your data regularly** (see Data Management)

**Don't worry** - We can recover lost matches if you have the JSON files!

---

### "I forgot the Scorer PIN"

**Contact your match admin** - They set the PIN for each match.

**Admin:** If you forgot what PIN you set:
1. Go to Dashboard
2. Look at "In Progress Matches"
3. The PIN is shown there
4. Share it with the scorer

---

### "Wrong PIN error when scoring"

**Common causes:**
- ❌ Entered wrong PIN (ask admin to verify)
- ❌ PIN has spaces (remove them)
- ❌ You're trying to start new match (need **ADMIN PIN: 3425**)
- ❌ This is a different match (each match has different PIN)

**Fix:**
- Double-check PIN with admin
- Make sure you're resuming the right match
- Try typing PIN character by character slowly

---

### "Can't find the match I created"

**Matches are stored locally on your device.**

**If match is not showing:**
1. **Check you're on same device** (phone/computer where you created it)
2. **Check browser** (Safari vs Chrome vs Firefox stores data separately)
3. **Check "In Progress Matches"** section
4. **Don't clear browser data** or it will delete matches!

**Prevention:**
- ✅ Export match as JSON before deleting
- ✅ Keep backups of important matches
- ✅ Don't share device or clear its browser cache

---

### "Export/Download not working"

**Issue:** Export button not downloading file

**Solution:**
1. **Check browser download settings** - Allow downloads for batball-three.vercel.app
2. **Try different browser** - Chrome, Safari, Firefox
3. **Check if file actually downloaded** - Look in Downloads folder
4. **Try on desktop** if mobile export fails

---

### "AI Match Report not generating"

**This feature requires API setup.** If it's not working:

1. **Check internet connection** (must be active)
2. **Wait 30 seconds** (takes time to generate)
3. **Try again** - Sometimes API is busy
4. **Don't worry** - Manual summary always works without it

**Admin:** This uses Google Gemini API. Contact support if consistently failing.

---

### "Live scoreboard won't display"

**For Billboard/Live View:**
1. **Open on same WiFi network** as the scorer's device
2. **Refresh the page** on the TV/display
3. **Make sure scorer device is scoring live** (not paused)
4. **Check if "Live View" button is available** on main device

---

### "Match scoring is slow or laggy"

**Optimization tips:**
1. **Close other browser tabs** (frees up memory)
2. **Restart the browser** 
3. **Try a different browser** (Chrome is fastest)
4. **Install as app** instead of using website
5. **Close other apps** on your phone (frees memory)
6. **Check WiFi connection** (move closer to router)

---

## FAQs

### Q: Will my data work if I get a new phone?

**A:** Data is stored locally on each device. 

**To transfer:**
1. **Export as JSON** on old phone (Dashboard → Export as JSON)
2. Share file to new phone
3. Open app on new phone
4. Click "Open Shared Scorecard"
5. Select the JSON file
6. Data now on new phone!

---

### Q: Can multiple people score the same match?

**A:** No. Only one scorer at a time (has the PIN).

**But you can:**
- Watch live on the TV via "Billboard View"
- View the scorecard when match finishes
- Share the final JSON file to WhatsApp for others to view

---

### Q: What happens if my phone dies mid-match?

**A:** Your data is saved automatically!

**When you restart:**
1. Open app
2. Click "Resume Match"
3. Enter Scorer PIN
4. All balls are still there - continue from where you left off

---

### Q: Can I edit a match after it's finished?

**A:** No. Finished matches are read-only (can't change).

**But you can:**
- Create a new match if you made mistakes
- Export the data as backup
- View all past matches in Club Hub

---

### Q: How long is data stored on my phone?

**A:** Indefinitely, unless you:
- Clear browser cache/data
- Uninstall the app
- Delete the app's storage manually

**Best practice:** Export important matches as JSON for long-term backup.

---

### Q: Is my data private?

**A:** Yes!

- ✅ All data stored locally on your device
- ✅ No data sent to servers
- ✅ PIN protected
- ✅ Only shared if YOU export and upload to WhatsApp
- ✅ Google Gemini API only sees match data if you generate AI report

---

### Q: Can I use Batball offline?

**A:** Yes!

**Scoring works offline:**
- ✓ Score matches without internet
- ✓ All data saved locally
- ✓ Data syncs when internet returns

**What needs internet:**
- ✗ First time loading (needs to download app)
- ✗ AI match reports (needs Gemini API)
- ✗ Exporting data (needs WiFi to download file)

---

### Q: Can I use it on multiple devices?

**A:** Yes, but data stays separate.

- Device 1 (phone) = one set of matches
- Device 2 (tablet) = different set of matches
- Device 3 (laptop) = different set of matches

**To sync:** Export from one device, import on another.

---

### Q: What's the difference between Admin PIN and Scorer PIN?

| PIN Type | Used For | Who Sets | Example |
|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Admin PIN (3425)** | Create/setup matches | Club admin | Used once at start |

### ❌ DON'T
- ❌ Share Admin PIN (3425) publicly
- ❌ Clear browser data (deletes all matches)
- ❌ Use in incognito/private browsing mode
- ❌ Assume data is backed up (always export)
- ❌ Share exported JSON files carelessly (has all player data)
- ❌ Forget to finish match (stuck in progress)
